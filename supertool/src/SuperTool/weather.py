        Make get requests to OpenWeather and Nominatim API using 'requests' module.
        First: make get request to Nominatim and receive longitude and latitude of requested location.
        Second: pass geo coordinates to OpenWeather API and receive weather five day forecast for every

        Third: call print_work to make a fancy output
